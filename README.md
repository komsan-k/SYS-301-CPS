# Cyber-Physical System (SYS-301)
## Course Evaluation Overview

## 📘 Course Description
A **Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** is an intelligent system in which physical processes are monitored or controlled by computer-based algorithms. In CPS, computational and physical components are tightly integrated, operating across different spatial and temporal scales. These systems exhibit multiple behavioral modes and dynamically interact with their environment and context.
