# Capstone Project – Cyber-Physical Systems (SYS-301)

## 🎯 Project Objective
The capstone project evaluates students’ ability to design and implement a **complete Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** by integrating physical processes, sensing, computation, communication, and actuation.

---

## 📌 Project Scope
Students must develop a **small-scale but functional CPS** that:
- Interacts with a real or simulated **physical process**
- Uses **sensors** to collect data
- Applies **control or decision logic**
- Drives **actuators** to affect the physical system
- Demonstrates a **feedback loop**
- Includes a **basic digital twin or visualization**

---

## 🧩 Mandatory System Components
Each project must clearly include:
- Physical Process (e.g., temperature, light, motion, humidity)
- At least one **Sensor**
- At least one **Actuator**
- **Controller / Cyber Layer** (ESP32, Arduino, or equivalent)
- **Communication** (Wi-Fi, MQTT, HTTP, etc.)
- **System Architecture Diagram**

Simulation-only projects are allowed **with proper justification**.

---

## 📂 Project Deliverables

### 1️⃣ Proposal — **2%**
- Problem statement
- CPS components
- Preliminary system architecture

### 2️⃣ Progress Report — **4%**
- Partial implementation
- Updated architecture diagram
- Code snapshots and early results

### 3️⃣ Final Project — **8%**
- Functional CPS implementation
- Final report
- Presentation and live or recorded demonstration

---

## 📝 Report Guidelines
The final report should include:
1. Introduction and motivation
2. CPS architecture and system overview
3. Hardware and software design
4. Control logic and feedback mechanism
5. Digital twin or visualization
6. Results and discussion
7. Challenges and lessons learned

Clarity and system understanding are prioritized over complexity.

---

## 📊 Assessment Criteria
Projects are evaluated based on:
- Correct identification of CPS elements
- Integration of cyber and physical components
- Functionality and reliability
- Quality of explanation and presentation
- Performance relative to peers (**Norm-Referenced Grading**)

---

## ⚖️ Academic Integrity
All submitted work must be **original**. External libraries, tools, and AI assistance may be used but must be **properly acknowledged**.

---

## 📤 Submission
All project materials must be submitted through the **Learning Management System (LMS)** by the announced deadlines.

---

## ✅ Notes
- Individual projects are allowed (as specified by the instructor).
- Students are encouraged to choose **realistic, real-world CPS applications**.
- Proper documentation and diagrams are required.
